# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis of how lifestyle choices and professional environments affect sleep quality and stress levels.

## Overview
The project uses **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** to explore correlations between occupation, BMI, physical activity, and cardiovascular health. It focuses on identifying the "high-risk" professions and biological indicators of exhaustion.

## Key Findings (Detailed inside the Notebook)
The analysis concludes that sleep quality is a result of complex interactions:
* **Occupational Impact:** Sales and Science roles show the highest stress levels, while Engineering provides the most stable sleep patterns.
* **Biological Indicators:** Heart rate serves as a direct indicator of stress, with resting BPM rising significantly when sleep quality drops.
* **Resilience Factors:** BMI and physical activity act as buffers, though they cannot fully compensate for extreme workplace stress (level 8+).

## Why This Project?
* **Interactive Visualization:** Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for clear data storytelling.
* **Holistic Approach:** Connects physical, psychological, and professional data points.
* **Reproducible Research:** The analysis is structured to be easily followed and replicated.
